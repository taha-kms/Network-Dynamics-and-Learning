# Network-Dynamics-and-Learning

This repository contains my coursework for the **Network Dynamics and Learning** course. It includes my solutions and implementations for the assigned homework exercises, covering various topics related to network theory, optimization, and learning dynamics.

## ðŸ“Œ Course Topics Covered
- **Network Flow and Optimization**: Computing network capacities, max-flow problems, and transportation networks.
- **Random Walks and Opinion Dynamics**: Simulating particle movements in graphs and analyzing consensus algorithms.
- **Traffic Flow and Equilibrium Analysis**: Investigating shortest paths, maximum flows, and toll-based traffic optimization.
- **Epidemic Modeling on Networks**: Simulating disease spread using SIR models and estimating real-world pandemic parameters.
- **Graph Coloring and Distributed Learning**: Applying graph coloring techniques for resource allocation.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `hw1/` - Network flow and traffic optimization exercises.
- `hw2/` - Random walk simulations, opinion dynamics, and multi-agent learning.
- `hw3/` - Epidemic modeling, vaccination strategies, and real-world pandemic estimation.

Each homework includes:
